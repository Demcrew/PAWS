        change = Added support for Kerbal Changelog
        change = Added new button to PAW which allows you to input Slider values manually, rather than having to fiddle with sliders. As I always say, sliders suck.
        change = PAWS menu is now accessible on unfocussed vessels. (2 years after it was first requested. No, I definitely didn't forget. It's just really difficult changing one instance of false to true.)
